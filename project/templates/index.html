            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The quality of education differs per country.
                We can certainly say that all aspiring students would rather study at one of the top
                ivy league universities, which are coincidentally located in the United States,
                than at a random university in Indonesia.
                An interesting sight is that the first-world countries
                tend to have the better universities than second- and third-world countries
                according to the <a href="https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2018">university rankings</a>.
                What seems to cause this geographical difference in quality of education?
                And does this difference occur on all levels of education?
            </p>
            <p>
                The biggest intergovernmental organisation concerning economic data, the OECD,
                holds a worldwide study every 3 year on 15-year-old school pupils' scholastic performance on mathematics, science, and reading since the year 2000.
                A very interesting sight is that the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisa-2015-results-in-focus.pdf">top 20</a> only consists of first-world and Asian countries.
                It would be very narrow-minded to say that the pupils in these countries are just smarter than their peers.
                Therefore I brainstormed possible factors for this finding. The following possible factors came to my mind when looking at the PISA scores;
                <ul>
                    <li>A country being straight up rich should have a beneficial influence on the quality of education, because of this I decided to look at the <b>GDP per capita</b>.</li>
                    <li>In general, higher investments should have a positive effect on the subject that is invested on. Concerning my subject, I've looked at the <b>education expenses per student</b> of countries.</li>
                    <li>At last, people tend to work harder when they receive a higher salary than their peers. For this reason, I've looked at the <b>average teacher salary</b> per country.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                To keep the topic relevant, I've only looked at 2012 and 2015 data.

            <h2>Visualization summary</h2>
            <p>
                <h4>World map</h4>
                The world map is colored according to the accumulated PISA score. Use pan and zoom to check for countries that are too small at first sight.
                If you want to know the exact stats of the country, simply click on a country.
                This will redirect you to the radar chart.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4>Radar chart</h4>
                The radar chart shows the stats of the country. Check the <a href="https://github.com/KevinVuongly/programmeerproject/blob/master/REPORT.md">report</a>
                to see how the stats are calculated.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4>Scatterplot</h4>
                The scatterplot shows the correlation, through the regression line, between the PISA score and the variable(which can be picked for by using the dropdown).
                Just like the world map, by clicking on a dot will update the radar chart according to the country.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4>Slider</h4>
                The slider updates all visualizations according the to the year picked for.
