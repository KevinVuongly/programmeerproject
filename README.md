## Problem statement
Every country differs from quality of education.
For example, given the PISA index in 2015, Singapore scored way higher than Tunisia in every aspect.
Striking is the fact that the richer countries score higher than the poorer countries.
By making an interactive visualization of possible factors for example education spending, GDP or teacher salaries,
we try to show that investing into education has a positive effect on the quality of education.

## Solution

##### Summary
The main visualization is the world map based on the PISA index for it's legend,
views linked to this visualization get updated by clicking on a country.
